# Ridiculously Simple App Engine Boilerplate

Absolutely the simplest App Engine app I could imagine. 

No backend. Everything goes through the .yaml file. 

Static files are in the /static folder. 

## Instructions

Edit deploy.sh so it points to your app engine id (replace [app id]).

Run deploy.sh to deploy to your app engine instance of choice.

Run dev_server.sh to run a local server hosted at localhost:8080 by default.
